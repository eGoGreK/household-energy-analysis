# 📊 Household Energy Consumption Analysis  

### 🔍 Overview  
This project analyzes household electricity consumption using real-world data. We explore:  
✅ Overall consumption trends  
✅ Average consumption per day and hour  
✅ Histogram of energy consumption distribution  
✅ Peak consumption hours  
✅ **Interactive visualizations with Plotly**  
✅ **Machine learning model for energy consumption prediction**  

### 📂 Project Structure  
- `data/` – Raw data files  
- `data_exploration.py` – Initial data exploration  
- `energy_analysis.py` – Main analysis and visualizations  
- `interactive_analysis.py` – **Interactive visualizations with Plotly**  
- `ml_model.py` – **Training the machine learning model**  
- `ml_predict.py` – **Using the trained model for prediction**  

### ⚙️ Requirements
